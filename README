Go to the directory you want all of your code to be located in. Then create a copy of the repository into your computer with this command:
git clone https://github.com/RishuvDutta/Sahaya-Cards-Website.git

You will now see a folder in the directory called Sahaya-Cards-Website. This is where all your code will go into.
Everytime you reached a good stopping point save your work and then execute the following commands:
git add .
git commit -m 'put some message explaining the changes you made"
git push

These commands will essentially update the repository in GitHub so that everyone else on the team has the most up to date version.

If you see that people have added commits to the repository and want those commits on your computer. First follow lines 5-7, then use the command
git pull
